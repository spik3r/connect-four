This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Connect Four
Can be viewed on [Heroku](https://react-connect-four.herokuapp.com/)

Simple connect-four game inspired by the Hasbro colour theme :)
Made using 
- React,
- Redux _(although this probably isn't using best practices since I learnt that as I made this)_
- Flexbox

From the project directory:

### To Play the game: `yarn start`

Runs connect in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play it in the browser.

### To Run the unit tests: `yarn test`
